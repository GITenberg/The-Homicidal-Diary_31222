<h1>The Homicidal Diary</h1>
<p class='center' style='font-size:1.3em'>By EARL PEIRCE, JR.</p>
<p class='center'><i>What strange compulsion drove an ordinarily gentle and cultured man, on one<br />
night of each week, to roam the city streets and<br />
commit a ghastly crime?</i></p>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">I am</span> writing this account of my
friend Jason Carse in the interests of
both justice and psychiatry, and perhaps
of demonology as well. There is no
greater proof of what I relate than the
sequence of murders which so recently
shocked this city, the newspaper items regarding
the crimes, and especially the
official report of the alienists who examined
Carse during his trial. I cannot expect
to bring Doctor Carse back to life,
for he was hanged until dead, but I do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_438' name='page_438'></a>438</span>
hope that this paper will offer new illumination
on cases of criminal decapitation.</p>
<p>Justice and psychiatry are closely related,
but it is difficult to recognize the
judicial importance of so <i>outr&eacute;</i> a subject
as demonology. Yet I emphatically assert
that the case of Jason Carse is irrevocably
concerned with evil and dark lore such as
mankind has not known since the Holy
Inquisition.</p>
<p>One is naturally prejudiced against
Carse, for even I myself, his lifelong acquaintance,
was struck with repugnance
when I first realized the nature of his
activities, but his death on the gallows
should foreclose biased reflection and
permit the student to regard his case in a
purely empirical light. As I am the only
man in complete possession of the facts,
it behooves me to give this astounding
information to the world.</p>
<p>Jason Carse was a brilliant and respected
criminologist, and at the time of his
arrest he was recognized as one of the
greatest students of the modern world, a
fact which has made his case one of unparalleled
notoriety. I was his roommate
during the several years we spent in law
school, and, although he shot to the pinnacle
of his branch of jurisprudence while
I was left to more prosaic routine, we
never lost the contact which has now become
so valuable. Our correspondence
was frequent and regular since we were
graduated, and I can say with justifiable
pride that Carse respected my friendship
as much as that of any other acquaintance,
if not more. It was this intimacy
with his personal life which has enabled
me, as friend and confidant, to witness
the revolting atavism which resulted in
such outrageous crimes.</p>
<p>I obtained my first hazy acquaintance
with the crimes three months ago when
I received Carse&rsquo;s letter from Vienna. He
had just discovered sensational evidence
in a famous criminal case&mdash;one of recurrent
human decapitation&mdash;and his consequent
enthusiasm was so rabid that I was
afraid the morbidity of such matters was
beginning to pervert his senses. For several
years I had become progressively
aware of Carse&rsquo;s melancholic attitude, and
I had often recommended that he take a
vacation from criminal cases. His indefatigable
enthusiasm for research was all
against my advice, and he had gone relentlessly
ahead to the tragic climax
which my greatest fears could not have
imagined. This letter from Vienna, so
eager with indomitable <i>il faut travailler</i>,
confirmed my suspicion that Carse had
descended into the depressing rut of
monomania.</p>
<p>When he returned to America shortly
afterward I crossed the country to spend
a few days with him, but he was so sickly
and irritable that I could do nothing to
cheer his spirits. He continually brooded
over the case he had been investigating,
and I should have known at that time
there was a dangerous neurotic compulsion
stirring in his subconscious mind.</p>
<p>Less than a week after my departure
from the city the first of the horrific head-hunting
crimes was committed and the
actual drama got under way. I can recall
reading the sensational accounts in
the newspapers and my anxious fear that
this fresh display of criminal perversion
would excite Carse into a state nearing
hysteria. I telegraphed him that same
day, begging his refusal to bother with
the case and requesting that he come to
visit me. His reply was swift and brief;
he had already commenced his investigations
of the head-hunting crime and
nothing on earth could deter him from
his set course. Knowing him as I did, I
could do nothing but hope that the Head-hunter
would be swiftly captured and the
case brought to a finish. It was an unpleasant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_439' name='page_439'></a>439</span>
shock, therefore, when I read&mdash;exactly
one week later&mdash;that a second and
identical crime had been committed.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">Even</span> in my own city, three thousand
miles from the center of the crimes,
there was wild confusion at the announcement
of this second spectacular murder.
The reader may recall the international
effects of the infamous &ldquo;Ripper&rdquo; crimes
which terrified London a few decades
ago and he will understand how rapidly
the Head-hunter&rsquo;s fame spread through
crime-conscious America. Both murders
were made particularly mysterious because
of the disappearance of the victims&rsquo;
heads. I knew the damaging influence
which these doings would produce upon
Carse, for he had always been interested
in decapitations, and his thesis at the
University of Graz had been based upon
the mad career of Emil Drukker, the
Head-hunter of Cologne.</p>
<p>I wrote again to Carse and begged him
to abandon his studies in these new murders,
but, as before, his response was cold
and discouraging. There was a wild and
almost fanatical tone in his letter which
was indicative of his obsessed mind, and
an ugly premonition occurred to me that
this would be the breaking-point of his
career.</p>
<p>The third and fourth murders, so horribly
identical with the first two, came
about at weekly intervals, and the city
was in the grip of strangling terror.
There was no rime or reason for the
crimes, and yet the diabolical precision of
the murderer seemed to indicate he was a
madman of uncanny intelligence. In all
four cases his victims were vagabonds and
people of the lowest order. In none of
the murders had the victim been assaulted,
but the head had disappeared,
seemingly for ever. There was not a
shred of evidence pointing to the solution,
and, except that the police knew
him to be a homicidal maniac, there was
not a single person in a city of several
millions whom they could call the murderer.
Far worse than the four murders
committed was the belief that they would
continue week after week to an indeterminable
conclusion.</p>
<p>I left for the city by plane on the evening
of the discovery of the fifth victim,
and during the trans-country flight I read
Carse&rsquo;s own statement in the <i>Metropolitan
Gazette</i> citing the crime as an atavistic
expression of animalism. The fact
that two of the five victims had been
men, according to Carse&rsquo;s theory, belied
the popular suspicion that the criminal
was a homicidal sadist. Carse expressed
the belief that the murderer was in the
grip of some inherent savagery, and that
the ghastly murders would continue until
he wore himself out by the sheer expenditure
of energy.</p>
<p>I reached the city shortly after sundown,
and at once I felt the awful tension
which had settled upon everyone in it.
Men and women moved furtively, airport
officials and police examined every
strange face with cold and scrutinizing
suspicion, and even my taxi-driver, a
small mousy man, kept his fear-laden
dark eyes continually reverting to the
mirror as he whirled me through the
slight evening traffic. I was surprized,
therefore, in view of this mutual distrust,
to find that Jason Carse, a veteran criminalist,
had discharged all of his servants
and was living alone in his grim house
behind a barricaded door.</p>
<p>The most unpleasant shock was the unaccountably
cold manner in which Carse
received my visit, and his positive annoyance
that I had forced myself so unexpectedly
upon him. He would not explain
why he had discharged his servants,
nor the secluded life he was now leading,
but there was little difficulty in realizing
the fatiguing effects which these recent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_440' name='page_440'></a>440</span>
crimes had pronounced upon him. He
was virtually a stranger as we met in the
hallway and shook hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d go to a hotel,&rdquo; he said
bluntly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anyone here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t go to a hotel. I told him
flatly that there was no other course open
to me but to stay and take care of him;
for obviously he wasn&rsquo;t taking care of
himself, and his dismissal of the household
help had precipitated a needless burden
on his already over-laden shoulders.
He needed food, for he was thin to emaciation,
and I made him dress at once and
accompany me to a restaurant where I
saw that he ate a decent meal. I then led
him to the theater, a particularly lively
musical comedy, and kept him in his seat
until the curtain had fallen. But my efforts
seemed of no avail, as he was continually
depressed and absorbed in his
own reflections. That night before retiring
he came to my room and again asked
me to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for your own good,&rdquo; he said with
strange harshness. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake believe
what I say!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">For</span> the next several days I watched
him sink lower and lower into despondency
of so contagious a nature that
I felt the insufferable pangs of it myself.
He worked late at night on the murder
cases, referring constantly to autopsy protocols
and police memoranda, and more
than once I saw him reading his Bible.
On several occasions he visited the county
morgue and examined the remains of the
Head-hunter&rsquo;s victims, and following
each such visit he lapsed into a state of
mental and physical agitation that exhausted
him within a few hours.</p>
<p>The nights were almost unbearable,
and I would lie awake for hours listening
to the mumbles and moans which came
from his room, oftentimes distinguishing
such words as &ldquo;God forbid it! God forbid
it!&rdquo; and frequently he would scream the
word &ldquo;Head-hunter.&rdquo; There was no
doubt that Carse had delved too deeply
into this case, and that hour by hour he
was descending into the clutch of a dangerous
neurosis.</p>
<p>During my stay with him I engaged
several servants, but he discharged them,
and I was unable to reconcile him to my
point of view. His resentment of my visit
became more acute as the days passed,
and I was beginning to fear that he would
forcibly eject me.</p>
<p>It was easy to explain this increased
irritability, for I myself, as well as every
soul in the city, was nervously awaiting
the next prowl of the Head-hunter, and
in it I recognized more fuel for the fire
that was burning Carse&rsquo;s reason. He was
waiting for the fatal Monday night as a
man waits for his doom, and each hour
found him closer to a mental attack. On
Sunday afternoon I discovered him in my
room packing my luggage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I appreciate
your interest in me, but now you
must go&mdash;you must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tremor of anxiety in his voice
nearly convinced me that he was right,
but doggedly I clung to my set purpose to
save him in spite of himself. I could not
leave him alone in face of the developments
which would occur sometime between
then and Tuesday morning, and
I told him so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; he exploded; &ldquo;I can do nothing
with you. Stay if you wish&mdash;but it&rsquo;s
on your own head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The irony of that final statement,
whether intentional or not, is something
I shall remember to my grave. I don&rsquo;t
think that Carse meant it literally&mdash;<i>on
my own head</i>&mdash;but I was unable to shake
his words out of my ears, and throughout
the night and the following day they
hung about me like a dirge.</p>
<p>Carse did not sleep at all that Sunday
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_441' name='page_441'></a>441</span>
night, but paced up and down in his
study while a fierce, alarming expression
hardened on his features. Nor could I
sleep, for his continued pacing tore my
nerves to shreds, and I spent the night
alternately in my own room and at the
partly open doorway of the library, where
I was able to watch him in secrecy. Several
times I saw him bend over a small
book and study it with the intent regard
of a disciple, and each time that he referred
to a certain page he pounded his
fist on the desk and cried to himself:
&ldquo;God forbid! God forbid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should have realized what he meant.
I should have known and been prepared,
but how blind my friendship made me to
the horrific implication of those repeated
words!</p>
<p>Monday came and went in a slow drizzle
of rain which only added to the
somber quiet of the city, and as the evening
approached and wore on I felt myself
caught in the irresistible tide of fearful
anticipation which warned of the
sixth appearance of the Head-hunter. The
streets were deserted throughout the day,
and with but few exceptions the only
pedestrians were police officers, who now
traveled in pairs or squads. The evening
papers were brutally frank in predicting
that before dawn a sixth headless corpse
would be discovered, and this expectation
was shared by all.</p>
<p>Carse was at home all day and refused
to answer the telephone or to allow me
to answer it for him. He ate sparingly,
with his same preoccupation, and, contrary
to my expectations, he appeared to
have lapsed into a state akin to normality,
like a man who contemplates a preordained
and inexorable occurrence.</p>
<p>At six o&rsquo;clock he came to me, ghastly
haggard and thin, and again asked me to
leave his house, but I refused this zero-hour
request. He shrugged and went
back to his study. I watched him for a
while and saw that he was studying that
queer little book which so deeply affected
him, and I again heard him utter those
despairing words: &ldquo;God forbid! God
forbid!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">I went</span> to bed at a little after ten and
tried to sleep, but the city-wide excitement
seeped into my room and kept
me tossing from the thrusts of nightmares.
At midnight Carse came up and
stopped just outside my door, obviously
listening to determine whether I was
asleep. The silence was uncanny for a
moment; then I heard a sharp metallic
clicking and he went on to his room.
After he had closed his door, I swept my
sheet aside and went to my own door.
Carse had locked it from the outside!</p>
<p>I called to him for an explanation of
this conduct, but he either didn&rsquo;t hear me
or chose to ignore my requests, for the
house remained grimly silent. Returning
to bed, I managed somehow to doze off.</p>
<p>At two o&rsquo;clock I was awakened by the
sound of someone&rsquo;s walking in the hallway.
I sat bolt-upright in bed and heard
the unmistakable approach of footsteps
coming down the corridor from Carse&rsquo;s
bedroom. The tread was stealthy and determined,
and as it drew closer to my
room I was conscious of a cold mask of
sweat clinging to my face, because the
footsteps did not sound like those of
Jason Carse!</p>
<p>The feeling hit me and hit me again
until I was left stunned with the horror
of it. It did not sound like Carse! But
if it was not Carse, <i>who was it?</i></p>
<p>I wanted to call out his name, yet I
felt, with some indefinable sense, that
the treader in the hall was unaware that
I was in the house, and for that reason it
could not have been Carse. I was afraid
to make an outcry, and I sat stricken with
dread as the footsteps went past my door
descending the stairs. A moment later
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_442' name='page_442'></a>442</span>
there was a noise of cutlery being moved
in the kitchen, and the front door opened
and closed.</p>
<p>As it had come, that strange prescience
vanished and I tried to reason out what
I had heard. Of course the man was
Carse; who could it have been save him,
for were we not alone in the house? I sat
for hours on the bed working up a determination
to shake the truth out of him
when he returned, but shortly after four
o&rsquo;clock my strength ran out of me and I
shook with fear as I heard that awful
ghost-like tread ascending the stairs.
My heart beat wildly when the person
reached my door and twisted the knob to
enter.</p>
<p>One thought flashed through my head:
Thank God the door was locked! The
terrible feeling that it was not Carse came
back upon me, and I sat motionless as I
listened to the sounds from outside. For
a moment there were no sounds from the
intruder, but I did hear a faint tap-tap-tap
like that of a liquid falling to the
wooden floor. In a minute the knob was
released and the footsteps continued
down the hall to Carse&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>Any attempt to explain my thoughts as
I sat smoking throughout the night would
only add to the confusion of these revelations.
They were not sane and rational
thoughts, but rather strange suggestions
and premonitions. I thought myself to
be in the presence of a tremendous evil.</p>
<p>In the morning Carse was up early,
and moved back and forth in the corridor
with strange industry. He was crying,
for his sobs came disturbingly to my
ears, and once I heard him descend into
the cellar and there was a faint digging
sound as he performed some outlandish
task. Then I heard him in the hallway
and on the stairs. I heard the splashing
of water and the sound of scrubbing.</p>
<p>I pounded on the door for him to let
me out, but it was not until nearly noon
that he finished his chores and finally
opened my door. He was stooped and
fatigued, and without bothering to return
my amenities, he turned away and went
to his study.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">I went</span> into the hallway and noticed, as
I had surmised, that the floor showed
signs of recent and vigorous cleaning. I
walked down to his room and looked in,
not surprized to notice that here, too, was
the unmistakable evidence of scrubbing.
I knew there was only one more thing to
do; I must go down to the cellar and unearth
what he had buried there!</p>
<p>The horrible truth had been dawning
upon me for hours, and when I came
face to face with him in the kitchen at
the head of the cellar stairs I looked
squarely into his eyes with the full realization
that Jason Carse was the Head-hunter.</p>
<p>I was not frightened&mdash;not for my personal
safety, at any rate&mdash;but a sensation
of sickening horror went through
me as I looked into his tired face and
understood that at last he had fallen into
the cesspool which had tormented him
since early years. The words of the coroner
came back into my ears: &ldquo;He is a
madman of uncanny intelligence,&rdquo; and I
knew that he knew I recognized him for
what he was.</p>
<p>The awful silence of our conflicting
glances was unbroken for several seconds,
and then words came uncontrollably from
my mouth and I managed to snap that
nerve-cracking tension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in the cellar?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;What
have you buried there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anything happens to you,&rdquo; he returned,
ignoring my questions, &ldquo;I am not
to be blamed. I warned you in time to
get away from this house. What do <i>you</i>
think is in the cellar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare to suggest there are six small
graves.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_443' name='page_443'></a>443</span></div>
<p>An ugly smirk went across his face and
he cast a glance at the cellar door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always were too smart for your
own good,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;Knowledge
can be dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you think you could get
away with it?&rdquo; I screamed, only too well
aware of his implication. &ldquo;My God,
Carse! Six human heads!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His jaw hardened and he took a menacing
step toward me. Then suddenly
he stopped, a queer tragic expression coming
over his face. He put his hand to
his eyes as if to blot out some horrible
memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know!&rdquo; he cried hysterically.
&ldquo;Six heads&mdash;six human heads! Do
you think I planned six heads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shudder went through him and he
buried his face in both hands and sobbed
like a child.</p>
<p>My personal fear gradually subsided as
I watched this remorseful quiescence
which had come upon him. I realized
that he had passed the emotional climax
of his crime, and that he was now suffering
that terrible reaction which must
haunt and terrify all criminals. I took
this advantage to gain control of him, for
there was no way of determining when
his madness would flare again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one course open for
me,&rdquo; I told him soberly. &ldquo;I must turn
you over to the police. Things like this
must be stopped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled his hands away from his
face and stared at me, his eyes fired with
dread. &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
give me away. Please, in the name of
God, don&rsquo;t give me away! I am sick, I
tell you! I am not responsible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A feeling of helpless pity went through
me as he sank to his knees in hysterical
imploration, but I steeled myself against
him. The man was mad and dangerous.
He must be stamped out without mercy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are asylums&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You know
what they do in asylums. <i>I</i> know! Please
help me. I am not responsible. It is the
book&mdash;<i>the book</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drukker&mdash;that diary! Can&rsquo;t you see
what it has done to me? It&rsquo;s eaten into
my brain until I am mad. It&rsquo;s driven me
like a slave until I have no other bidding.
It taught me how to do these things. It
<i>makes</i> me do them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pulled him to his feet and shook him
unmercifully. He was crying and retching,
a pitiable and horrible sight to look
upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are talking irrationally,&rdquo; I cried.
&ldquo;I am your friend and I want to help you,
but my first duty is the public welfare.
There are six human heads buried in your
cellar. There must be no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more?&rdquo; he laughed shrilly and
threw up both his hands to indicate the
count of ten. &ldquo;No more, you say? There
will be ten more before it stops. Ten
more! That&rsquo;s what the book says!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want ten?&rdquo; I demanded incredulously,
struck numb by his callousness.
&ldquo;You want ten more to add to those six?
Carse, Carse! They are not cabbages you
are counting; they are human heads. Do
you think I am a fiend to let this continue?
No; it must end&mdash;it must end on
the gallows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> died on the gallows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He? Whom are you talking about?
Try to make sense, Carse. I am your
friend; trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am talking of Emil Drukker&mdash;the
man who taught me how to do these
things. He is responsible for them, not
I. He is the one to hang for them. Dig
him out of his grave and hang him
again!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_444' name='page_444'></a>444</span></div>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">I pushed</span> him gently into a chair, for
his collapse seemed imminent. Spittle
was running from his mouth, and his
retching continued in spasms that shook
him to his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your friend,&rdquo; I told him again.
&ldquo;I want to help you, but you must get
control of yourself. Why do you say you
are not responsible? What drove you to
commit these crimes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me searchingly and his
eyes cleared. He swallowed a mass of
incoherent words in an effort to master
himself; then his hand pressed over mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right; I must get control of
myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have done some horrible
things which can never be forgiven,
but I swear to you that I have not done
them intentionally. And I am not mad as
you think. I am in the power of that
book. I am the puppet of a horror that
has outlived all natural deaths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A feeling of relief passed over me as
I saw him settle into a state of rational
observation. I hoped it would last, for
not three yards away from him, lying on
top of the kitchen table, was a seven-inch
butcher knife. My only hope was to preserve
his state by permitting him to tell
his story, and in that way to persuade
him to accept the inevitable consequences
of his crimes. I drew up a chair beside
his own, yet kept myself alert to ward
off any lunge he might make for the
knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this horror which has mastered
you?&rdquo; I asked in an effort to gain
his confidence. &ldquo;And what is this book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you about it in my letter from
Vienna six weeks ago. I told you I had
discovered a rare book&mdash;an awful and
compelling book. It was the diary of
Emil Drukker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He cast a swift glance about the room,
then suddenly his eyes fell upon the
butcher knife. I saw him tense, saw his
lips twitch under the lash of a horrible
temptation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carse, tell me about it!&rdquo; I yelled, to
distract him. &ldquo;Where did you get the
book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled his eyes away from the knife
and let them burn into my face. For a
moment, undecided, he was silent; then
his brows straightened and he leaned forward
in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember my Graz thesis? It
was based upon the life of Emil Drukker
in an effort to explain what impulse drove
him to cut off human heads. It was a
good thesis, one of the best on the subject,
and it brought a lot of response from
criminologists all over the world. About
six months after it was published I received
a letter from a man who was once
Emil Drukker&rsquo;s personal servant. He was
living in Cologne right close to the old
Drukker castle, and he wanted to see me.
He told me that he knew the Drukker
crimes from the first to the last&mdash;sixteen
of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I went, of course, and met this
man, who was small and old, with an obsession
for Emil Drukker. He talked for
a long time, and then he handed me the
diary and said it explained more vividly
than I could ever imagine the impulse
which prompted Drukker&rsquo;s recurrent human
decapitations. He told me that
Drukker had written each entry while the
memory of the crime was still fresh in his
mind. It was a terrible book to read, he
warned, and unless I had the intellectual
strength of a mental Hercules I would
never forgive myself for having opened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally I was too excited to heed
his warning, and on that same night I
took the book away with me. I promised
to return it to him when I had finished,
but he wouldn&rsquo;t accept this plan. Instead
he said that he would come and get the
book when I was through. It was a mysterious
business and should have told me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_445' name='page_445'></a>445</span>
to expect no good to come of it. I asked
him how he would know when I had finished
with the book, and I shall never
forget that evil smile and disdainful
shrug of his response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I shall know well enough when I
read the newspapers,&rsquo; he told me. &lsquo;This
time it will be six or seven&mdash;in about four
months from now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you understand what he meant
by those words? He knew what would
happen! And yet he let me carry that
book away with me! In the name of
God, what kind of a man is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you destroy the book?&rdquo;
I demanded of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t! It was too fascinating, too
powerful to destroy. I read that book
with the reverence of an ecclesiastic until
I knew every word between the covers,
and the whole ghastly parade of Drukker&rsquo;s
sixteen murders passed before my
eyes like figures on a stage. Ten weeks
ago I began to have nightmares that reconstructed
the crimes of Drukker, going
chronologically from Number One to
Number Sixteen, then beginning all over
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I returned to America seven
weeks ago I still had the book with me,
and the contents were so deeply engraved
on my brain that I could think of nothing
else. Day and night I thought about it,
until at length I found myself actually
imagining how I would go about emulating
his crimes. Then I began to get
the horrible impulse to fondle a butcher
knife&mdash;Drukker used a butcher knife, you
know!&mdash;and more than once I was struck
with the scarcely resistible urge to cut off
someone&rsquo;s head. It didn&rsquo;t matter whose
head&mdash;but just a head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, Carse!&rdquo; I cried with a wary
glance at the kitchen table. &ldquo;Tell me the
rest, but don&rsquo;t excite yourself. What happened
then?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">He slid</span> back in a sort of stupor,
shook his head several times, then
passed his hand across his eyes in a gesture
of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to know damned well
what happened if you were listening at
your door last night. Six weeks ago I
went to bed and dreamed horribly. I
had just finished reading the first confession
in the diary&mdash;some strange impulse
made me read <i>that</i> confession and no
other&mdash;and in my sleep I saw a human
head staring at me. It was a cruel, Teutonic
head, and I knew that it was Emil
Drukker&rsquo;s head hanging in a gallows
rope. Then he smiled at me; a horrible,
vivid, real smile, and the head vanished.
From then on, for how long I cannot say,
I sat as a spectator and watched the complete
action of Drukker&rsquo;s Number One.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw Drukker leave his house and
walk down a dark street with no other
illumination than a few scattered electric
lights. I tried to imagine how they were
electric lights, for they had only gas in
his day, but nevertheless they were modern
lights, and the street looked like the
street in front of my own house. He
walked about ten blocks; then he saw a
woman standing on a street corner.
There wasn&rsquo;t another soul in sight. He
crept closer to her, then drew out his
butcher knife and hid it in the folds of
his coat&mdash;a coat which looked strangely
like my own wind-breaker. He first tried
to talk with the woman, but she was not
interested; so he pulled out the knife and
brought it sweeping down across her
throat. The blood spurted like a fountain
and overran Drukker&rsquo;s hand, but he
only laughed and pushed the woman to
the ground, then knelt over her and began
a horrible sawing movement with
his knife. When he had finished, he
drew a towel from his pocket and
wrapped the head tightly to prevent the
blood from trailing him home. He came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_446' name='page_446'></a>446</span>
back the same way and entered the house,
and at the foot of the stairs he unwrapped
the towel and held the thing only by its
hair as he climbed the steps. The last
thing I saw or heard was the blood dripping
on each step as he ascended to the
upper hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; I whispered in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s not the worst,&rdquo; Carse cried
as he grabbed my arm. &ldquo;When I awakened
the next morning it was late and the
shrieks of the newsboys stabbed into my
ears. They were yelling about a cruel,
brutal murder which had been committed
sometime during the night. I swung my
feet off the bed to arise, when my eyes
fell upon the diary which rested on my
night-table. It was open to the confession
of Number One as if I had been
reading it in my sleep. There was a
strange and terrifying dread in my soul
as my feet struck the floor. I felt something
wet and sticky touch my toes; then
I looked down. It was a woman&rsquo;s head
staring up at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The room was smeared with blood
from one end to the other, and there was
a gore-caked knife resting beside the
head, and a crimson towel lay across my
bedpost. But there wasn&rsquo;t a drop of blood
on my hands!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t even attempt to explain it.
I only knew that a woman had been murdered
and that her severed head was in
my bedroom. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do.
I couldn&rsquo;t force myself into the belief that
I was the murderer, and I stood stunned
with the weird horror of knowing that
Emil Drukker&rsquo;s Number One had been
re-enacted and that I had played his own
role. Where could I turn? Whom could
I ask for advice? If I was mad they
would commit me to an asylum; if I was
not mad they would hang me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I carried the head to the cellar and
buried it; then I cleaned up the blood
and burned the towel. In my wardrobe I
found a suit of clothes smeared with fresh
blood. I found my shoes and hat splattered
with it, and then I found my discarded
gloves stained a violent crimson,
with each finger stiffened as the blood
had coagulated about it. No wonder
there wasn&rsquo;t any blood on my hands!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went over the house from top to
bottom and eradicated every stain that
might be evidence against me; then I sat
down with the diary in one hand and
the morning newspaper in the other. I
compared the two crimes. They were
identical, even to the burying of the
heads. Emil Drukker had done exactly
the same as I had done: he carried the
head in a towel, he left it in his room overnight,
he buried it in his cellar, and he
cleaned up the blood the following morning.
But there was one ghastly difference:
Emil Drukker had committed his
crime with full purposeful foreknowledge,
whereas I had committed my crime
under hypnotic inducement!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no other answer for what
has happened in these last six weeks. I
have racked my brain to find another solution,
but there is none. I am being
hypnotized by some unexplainable force,
and once each week I come under the
power of this evil which directs and commands
my being. Last night I went to
bed with the full knowledge of what
would occur during the night. That is
why I locked you in your room. This
morning when I awakened I found the
head exactly where the other five had
lain; then I carried it to the basement and
buried it. I cleaned up the blood and
burned the towel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are numbed with horror, try to
imagine how I feel about it. Six crimes
in six weeks! And I can only thank merciful
God that it will end with only one
more. Perhaps it is ended now. That
German servant who loaned me the diary
said it would be only six or seven.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_447' name='page_447'></a>447</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the police will believe
all of this?&rdquo; I demanded. &ldquo;What you
have told me has no sane explanation.
It&mdash;it&rsquo;s demonism!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">Carse</span> smiled pitiably. &ldquo;There are
more things in heaven and earth,&rdquo;
he began; then he heaved his shoulders
as if flinging off an attempt at levity.
&ldquo;The human mind is a strange organ,
and no man can explain its mysteries. I
have seen too much of atavism to ridicule
any theories. There is nothing we
can do but wait and hope that the German
servant&rsquo;s prediction is true. Six or
seven. <i>Six</i>&mdash;or <i>seven</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean you expect me to grant
you leniency?&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Great heavens,
Carse, there have been six horrible
murders! Society demands a reckoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have atoned enough for ten times
six!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Have you no soul in you?
The crimes will stop now. The German
said they would, and everything else he
predicted has come true. As my lifelong
friend it is your duty to see me through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But those six&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No man can bring them back to life,
but I am still a living man and you must
save me. I shall divide my estate among
the families of the six, and I swear to
you that I shall never open a book on
criminology again. You must do it&mdash;you
must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you honestly believe it is over?&rdquo;
I asked hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do; with all my heart and soul, I
do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you would say that anyway,&rdquo; I
cried. &ldquo;Suppose there is a Number
Seven? The blood will be upon my hands
as well as yours. It is an awful responsibility,
Carse. There must be no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be. I swear there won&rsquo;t
be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw himself at me in an hysterical
outburst of emotion. He tried to
smile through the tears in his eyes, but
the sight was so awful that I turned my
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am still unconvinced,&rdquo; I said grimly.
&ldquo;The possibility of Number Seven is
too important to overlook. Let me see
Drukker&rsquo;s diary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he backed away and stared at
me. &ldquo;Why do you want to read the
diary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to read account Number
Seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carse came forward again and grabbed
my arm. He shook it. &ldquo;What good will
that do?&rdquo; he asked anxiously, &ldquo;if there
are only six of them? Besides, it&rsquo;s not a
book you ought to read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the diary!&rdquo; I demanded
again.</p>
<p>He scowled at me for a moment; then,
shrugging, he reached into his pocket and
withdrew a small leather-bound book. It
was well worn, as if by many thumbs,
and in faded gold letters across the cover
were the words: Personal Diary of Emil
Drukker, J. U. D.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; I commanded. &ldquo;And try
to keep your nerves together. I shall do
everything I can for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He backed away and dropped into a
chair, his eyes fastened upon me in a look
of almost majestic joy. And yet there was
an undertone in his expression which I
could not define. There was defiance
there ... and fear. One of his hands rested
on the near-by table, less than two feet
from the hilt of the butcher knife, and
the fingers of that hand twitched nervously.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">With</span> an odd sense of uneasiness I
flicked open the first several pages
of the book and skimmed through the
contents. My German was poor, yet I
was able to understand the significance of
what Emil Drukker had written in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_448' name='page_448'></a>448</span>
large, scrawling hand. I read the first
six accounts, then stared at Carse in
amazement. His six crimes and Drukker&rsquo;s
first six were so identical they might
have been conscious reproductions. In all
cases the victims were the same sex, the
same age, and were in the same general
walk of life. I then turned to account
Number Seven and after reading a few
wretched lines I gasped with horror: <i>it
was a seven-year-old girl!</i></p>
<p>Carse was on his feet, his jaw grim
and determined. He stared fiercely at
me, waiting my response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carse,&rdquo; I muttered dazedly, &ldquo;it&mdash;it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t back out,&rdquo; he cried as he
stepped toward me. &ldquo;There will be no
seven, I tell you. It&rsquo;s ended on six. I
swear it to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I cannot permit such a
risk. Did you read account Number
Seven? He not only cut off the head, but
he dismembered&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t back out!&rdquo; he screamed as
he shook my arm. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t, you
can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Carse, this is a girl&mdash;a mere
child. Don&rsquo;t you realize it would be unpardonable
even for you? No, I can
never take such a risk. I must turn you
over to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carse slapped me viciously, then stumbled
back against the table. His face was
a mask of suffused blood, his eyes wild
with desperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; he cried savagely. &ldquo;You
are no friend; you&rsquo;re a cheat, a betrayer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly his groping fingers touched
the butcher knife and he drew himself
taut. His fingers wound around the hilt
like slowly moving worms. For a moment
there was scarcely a breath between
us; then he lifted his arm and brought
the knife slowly out before him. I
watched, horror-stricken, unable to lift
my feet from the floor. A numbing
paralysis of fright seemed to come over
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carse, Carse!&rdquo; I muttered.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t hear me; his body was tensed
for the deadly spring that would bring
him down upon my throat. I saw a ripple
of galvanizing energy race through
his hands; then I managed an outcry. At
the same instant he was in the air.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class="caps">There</span> is no need for me to relate the
events which followed; for the newspapers
had assiduously described the capture
and arrest of Carse, and his subsequent
history, brief as it was, has become
public property. To my dying day I shall
carry the five-inch scar along my cheek
where his knife descended upon me, and
I can never cease to be thankful for that
one outburst of absolute fear which tore
from my lips and attracted a passing policeman;
otherwise I might have been
Number Seven in the grim line of epitaphs
that marked the close of this fantastic
case. Only by bludgeoning Carse
with his stick could the officer overcome
him, and it was necessary to keep him in
a straitjacket until the hour of his execution.</p>
<p>It is a curious fact that the psychiatrists
who examined Carse, several of them his
former pupils, could not find him unbalanced
enough to be irresponsible for
his crimes. Those long and tiring vigils
in the mental clinic will haunt me for
life; there was no end to their searching
and probing of his subconscious mind, no
end to the tests and questions, the examinations
and analyses which ended
hopelessly against him. But even if they
had found him insane, violently and
homicidally insane, they would not have
dared report such a finding to the court.
Society demanded a death in return for a
death, and Jason Carse was nailed to his
coffin at the first moment of his arrest.
Had he been spared the gallows by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_449' name='page_449'></a>449</span>
court, he would not have been spared the
gallows by the mobs that milled about the
detention prison; for continually throughout
the trial was the grim reminder that
society represented by mobs has not yet
forgotten the use of lynch law.</p>
<p>Carse&rsquo;s death put a definite end to the
head-hunting crimes in this city, and for
the first time in over six weeks the metropolitan
area has been able to breathe
freely. I have lost a faithful and sincere
friend; but I lost him, not on the gallows,
but three months ago when he first discovered
the diary of Emil Drukker.</p>
<p>It is the diary, not my mourning, which
has prompted me to pen this account of
my knowledge of the head-hunting
crimes. During the trial, as you may remember,
I sought to introduce the diary
as major evidence in support of Carse&rsquo;s
somnambulistic manias, but it was waived
out of court with ridicule and contempt.</p>
<p>One must admit that Carse&rsquo;s story as he
told it to me, and as I later reiterated it
to the court, was fantastic and highly improbable.
But there are certain irrefutable
arguments in support of Carse&rsquo;s
story which shed a terrible light, not
alone upon the case, but on all criminal
cases of similar nature. For one thing,
a hypnotic examination by competent state
alienists was completely unsuccessful in
the attempt to bring forth his subconscious
knowledge of any of the six murders.
Secondly, Carse was unable, despite
his most intense and willing efforts, to reconstruct
even the smallest part of any
one of the crimes. His only acquaintance
with his own alleged activities was
brought to him in <i>dreams</i>.</p>
<p>A further significant fact, which the
court ignored as irrelevant, was the ghastly
identity of Carse&rsquo;s supposed crimes and
those confessed by Emil Drukker. It is
impossible that this duality of murders
could be brought about by mere coincidence,
for the similarity of detail was carried
too far. This fact alone presupposes
the statement that there was a horrible
and unnatural bondage between Emil
Drukker and Jason Carse&mdash;the bondage
of the diary!</p>
<p>One night of each week for six weeks
Jason Carse was compelled by some unknown
power to dream about a murder
confessed and described in Drukker&rsquo;s diary.
On each of these nights, while Carse
watched it in a dream, an identical murder
was committed somewhere in the city
and the man whom he recognized as the
murderer was Emil Drukker. It was as if
Carse&rsquo;s dreams, projected into reality by
the sheer vividness of the diary, had resurrected
Emil Drukker from his grave
and set him free to re-enact his former
crimes!</p>
<p>I am mad, you will say; but I speak of
demonism and not law. How else can
you explain the duality of these murders?
How else can you explain Carse&rsquo;s ignorance
of the crimes? How else can you
explain those brutal dreams, the fruit of
whose reality Carse found each morning
on the floor beside his bed? Nor is it
enough to stop alone with this question.
How many men besides Jason Carse have
spent sleepless nights over the diary of
Emil Drukker?</p>
<p>The newspapers will answer that question
each time they are opened; in Paris
the police discover a headless body lying
along the wharves, and the murderer
is still unknown; in Berlin a college professor
kills himself upon the discovery of
a human head lying near his bed with
his own hunting-knife stuck to the hilt
into its brain; in Stockholm the police
discover the bodies of two women lying
in an empty house&mdash;their heads have not
yet been found; and in Cleveland, one of
our greatest cities, is reported the discovery
of the tenth headless corpse in a series
of murders that has gripped the city
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_450' name='page_450'></a>450</span>
in terror. What kind of person commits
such crimes? And why do the missing
heads turn up years later in the basement
of a house owned by a mild-appearing
and docile old man?</p>
<p>Jason Carse was not the first man to
pay with his life for crimes such as these,
nor is he the last. It is well to beware
of sickish-smelling trunks that are left in
deserted houses, and I caution the reader
against stepping on misshapen bundles
of clothing which he may find half hidden
in a clump of bushes.</p>
<p>For the diary of Emil Drukker is missing
from the drawer where I left it, and
I have been told that a strange, Germanic-looking
man was seen prowling about
the house just before its disappearance.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
